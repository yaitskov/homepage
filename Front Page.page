# Daniil Iaitskov homepage

![](/me.jpg){ width=2cm }

At last I decided to spend some time to discharge FB, github, blogger sites  
and to create a homepage in an old school way - hosted on my own virtual machine.     

I picked **gitit** wiki engine,
because I get again a Haskell bug 10 years after university.
At first it is working.
I can even upload pictures, but table and float support sucks.

~~~ { .haskell }
sort [] = []
sort (h:t) = [y| y <- t, y <= h]  ++ [h] ++ [x| x <- t, x > h]

data Free f a = Pure a | Free (f (Free f a))
~~~
